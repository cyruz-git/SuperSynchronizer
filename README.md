# SuperSynchronizer

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE. I'M IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS.**

*SuperSynchronizer* is an [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/) script that can be used for incremental and mirror directory synchronization. To use it only the AutoHotkey interpreter is required (**Unicode** version, 32 or 64 bit).

### How it works

The script is structured in to stages:

1. **REPLICATION CHECK**

    The files on the DESTINATION SIDE are synchronized with the files on the SOURCE SIDE.

2. **REVERSE CHECK**

    The files on the DESTINATION SIDE that don't exist on SOURCE SIDE are deleted.

The script can be instantiated multiple times, and the GUI will stack automatically starting from the TOP-RIGHT corner. A detailed log file is createad by default in *A_ScriptDir* (the script directory).

MIRRORING | Enable mirroring, deleting files on destination that are not present on source (1 to enable, 0 to disable).| `1` or `0`
SIMULATION | Enable simulation, forcing logging to store all operations that will be discarded (1 to enable, 0 to disable). | `1` or `0`
LOG_ENABLE | Enable logging, storing all operations history on file (1 to enable, 0 to disable) | `1` or `0`
LOG_FILE | Log file path (absolute path, without quotes). Default to *Scriptname*.**log** in the script directory. Will be created with a numerical suffix if other log files with the same name are present. | `C:\LogDir\MySync.log`
